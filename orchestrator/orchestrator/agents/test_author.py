"""Test-author agent — writes failing tests for ONE task, before implementation.

This is the role half of Phase 72's red-green separation: a DIFFERENT agent than
the implementer authors the tests, so the implementer can never write a test it
knows will pass (or weaken one on retry). It is an *agent loop* (like qa.py /
implementation), not a single LLM call: the author reads the task, designs a test
through the public interface, writes the test file(s), and runs the suite to
confirm the new tests fail.

What this module owns: the test-author prompt, its tools, the emit-tool schema,
and the `TestAuthorResult` factory. The surrounding red-green machinery — the
green→red transition check, the test-file snapshot the diff-gate freezes, and the
classic-fallback routing — lives in `workflow._run_test_author`, which calls this.

`TestAuthorResult` is on the workflow's serde allowlist so a mid-run resume
replays the authored result (the tests are NOT regenerated) — the whole point of
authoring once, before the retry loop.

Generic by design: nothing here is project-specific. The author judges
testability at runtime and emits `testable=False` with a reason when a behaviour
isn't unit-testable (or the criteria are too vague) — the workflow then falls back
to the classic implement→qa path for that task.
