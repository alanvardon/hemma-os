"""Summarizer agent — produces the commit/PR metadata.

The summarizer is a read-only agent that runs ONCE after the impl→QA retry block
passes: it reads the plan + `git diff HEAD` and emits {summary, test_plan}. A
diff-derived summary is more accurate than an agent's self-report (which drifts
from what it actually changed), and being read-only it carries no risk to the
tree. Keeping this concern out of the implementation producer is what lets that
producer be a *generic* retry-block producer.

It is the sibling of the docs agent: both are post-block, pre-commit,
read-the-diff agents. They stay separate — the summarizer *produces commit/PR
metadata* (read-only); the docs agent *edits `.md` files*.

Built on `run_structured_agent`, like every other agent.
