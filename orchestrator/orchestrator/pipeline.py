"""Phase 68: the v2 declarative pipeline — `stage` / `flow` / `builtin` / `defs`.

Parses the v2 config shape (see orchestrator.v2.example.toml at the project root)
into a resolved, validated, flow-ordered Pipeline.

This is the FOUNDATION layer for Phase 68: it is fully self-contained and
unit-tested, and is deliberately NOT yet wired into the live workflow (that
cutover is the follow-up). The running orchestrator still uses the v1 config in
config.py / manifest.py. Building v2 additively keeps the existing suite green
while the new model is proven in isolation.

Two axes decide where a thing lives (mirrors the example file):

    IN THE FLOW?           BUILT-IN?     TABLE
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    yes (a stage)          built-in      [stage.builtin.<id>]
    yes (a stage)          yours         [stage.user.<id>]
    no  (a reusable part)  built-in      [builtin.<id>]
    no  (a reusable part)  yours         [defs.<id>]

A STAGE's id IS its header's last segment. A reusable PART is referenced from a
stage's produce / gate / uses by a prefixed id: `builtin:<id>` or `defs:<id>`.
Order comes only from `flow`; the git rails are implicit, locked anchors.
