"""Deterministic git operations used by workflow tasks.

The orchestrator has a hard split:
  - cognition (planning, implementation, QA) → LLM-driven, probabilistic

This module owns the deterministic side. No prompts, no models, no
structured output — just shell commands wrapped in Python. The PR-creation

any step is recoverable via @task caching.
