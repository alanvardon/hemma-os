# Version of the @entrypoint body. Bump on INCOMPATIBLE body changes — reordered/
# removed tasks, new required tasks, changed control flow a half-finished checkpoint
# can't safely resume into. Pure additive changes (a new optional gate, a new
# trailing task legacy checkpoints haven't reached) don't strictly require a bump.
# On resume, the version stored at run creation is compared against this constant; a
# mismatch refuses the resume with a clear error rather than a confusing mid-run
# deserialization failure. Per-version history: ../CHANGELOG.md.
#
# 2.0.0 (Phase 68b): the declarative-pipeline cutover. The body now dispatches
# the post-branch stages from config.pipeline (the v2 `flow`) instead of the
# hard-coded spine + v1 [[steps.work]] seam; the manifest-hash resume gate became
# a pipeline-hash gate. An incompatible bump — old 1.x checkpoints cannot resume.
#
# 2.1.0 (Phase 72): the per-task station gained a run-once `test_author_task`
# (gated on config.tdd) before each task's implement loop — a new checkpointed
# @task in the body's task graph, so a half-finished 2.0.0 checkpoint can't safely
# resume into it. With tdd off (the default) the task is never called and the
# graph is identical to 2.0.0, but the body now CAN emit it, so the bump.
#
# 2.2.0 (Phase 72b): Task.acceptance_criteria became REQUIRED (was optional). The
# DecompositionResult is checkpointed; a pre-2.2.0 checkpoint may carry a task with
# no criteria, which now fails to deserialize — the version gate refuses that
# resume cleanly instead of a confusing mid-run ValidationError.
#
# 2.3.0 (Phase 72b): the supervised red-review pause + re-author escape. The per-
# task station now runs `_author_with_review`, which can emit a new `red_review`
# interrupt after red-confirm and loop `test_author_task` (with feedback/attempt) to
# re-author. New control flow + interrupt the body can reach → a half-finished 2.2.0
# checkpoint can't safely resume into it. Gated on config.tdd_red_review (default on).
#
# 2.4.0 (Phase 74): the per-task coverage critic. _author_with_review now runs a new
# checkpointed `critic_task` on the authored tests and can loop `test_author_task` to
# re-author on a negative verdict. A new @task in the body's graph → a half-finished
# 2.3.0 checkpoint can't safely resume into it. Gated on config.tdd_coverage_critic
# (default on); CoverageCriticResult is on the serde allowlist.
#
# 2.5.0 (Phase 76): autonomous-mode TDD. tdd + fully_autonomous is no longer refused
# at load; instead the per-task station runs a distinct `_run_autonomous_tdd_task`
# when both are on — a HARD red-confirm gate (a born-green / non-green-baseline /
# no-script-gate verdict aborts the task instead of degrading) plus a BOUNDED
# re-author cycle (the implement build runs bounded with on_exhausted="abort"; an
# exhausted build re-authors the tests, capped at tdd_autonomous_reauthor_max, then
# aborts). New control flow + new test_author_task / critic_task invocation patterns
# (per-round `attempt`) the body can now reach → a half-finished 2.4.0 checkpoint
# can't safely resume into it. With tdd or fully_autonomous off the supervised /
# non-TDD per-task graph is unchanged. No serde change (TestAuthorResult.degrade_kind
# is an additive optional field).
#
# 2.6.0 (Phase 77a): evidence foundations. StepResult gains a `full_output` field
# (the complete, untruncated runner log) and run_retry_block gains an `on_attempt`
# per-attempt hook. Both are additive and inert until a consumer is wired (77c), so
# the graph is unchanged — but a checkpointed StepResult shape changed, so a
# half-finished 2.5.0 TDD run can't resume across the upgrade and needs a fresh start.
#
# 2.7.0 (Phase 77b): test-author evidence folder. TestAuthorResult gains a `full_run`
# field (the COMPLETE final RED run, via 77a's full-output capture) — a checkpointed
# shape change on a serde-allowlisted model, so a half-finished 2.6.0 TDD run can't
# resume across the upgrade. The per-task `test-author/` folder (final tests copied
# verbatim + RED run + freeze hash + process summary.md) replaces the flat
# `test-author-<id>.md`. The post-branch task graph is unchanged (the writer is a
# side-effect after the authored verdict, like its predecessor) and TDD-off runs are
# byte-for-byte identical; the bump is purely for the changed checkpointed shape.
#
# 2.7.0 (Phase 77c, unchanged): impl attempt evidence — the FIRST consumer of both
# 77a seams. The TDD station wires run_retry_block's on_attempt hook (via _run_build_step
# / _run_task_build_step) to write task-NN-<id>/impl/attempt-N/ (the COMPLETE run via
# full_output + the freeze MATCH/MISMATCH vs the 77b baseline) for every implement
# attempt of a TESTABLE task — including the GREEN one. No new @task, no checkpointed
# shape change (the recorder is a best-effort side-effect in the entrypoint frame, like
# the 77b writer), so the graph is byte-for-byte unchanged and no bump is needed; the
# classic / non-TDD path passes on_attempt=None and writes nothing.

# byte the classic implement→qa loop. Graceful-degrade: a task the author judges
# untestable (or a born-green / no-script-gate situation) returns testable=False
# and runs the classic path — TDD never wedges a run.

    72b supervised red-review pause + re-author escape.

    Per task: author → (testable?) → COVERAGE CRITIC judges the tests; a negative
    verdict re-authors with the critic's feedback, bounded by tdd_critic_max_attempts
    (still weak after the budget → proceed and record a manual check; never wedges).
    Then, if tdd_red_review is on and the run isn't autonomous, PAUSE for a human:
      - an approve word ('yes'/…)  → return the verdict; the implement loop runs;

      - anything else              → treat as feedback and RE-AUTHOR (then re-critique).
    An untestable verdict returns immediately (classic fallback). Runs in the
    entrypoint frame so interrupt() is reachable; each re-author/critic round is a
    distinct test_author_task / critic_task @task (via `attempt`) so resume replays
    cleanly.

    Returns (verdict, attempt). `feedback`/`attempt` seed the loop so a caller can
    drive REPEATED rounds with a monotonic attempt counter (Phase 76's autonomous
    re-author cycle calls this once per round); the returned attempt is the value
    used for the LAST author call, so the next round passes attempt + 1 to keep
    every test_author_task / critic_task cache key unique even when the feedback
    string repeats. Supervised callers pass the defaults and ignore the count.
