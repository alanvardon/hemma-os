"""Runtime execution of injected steps.

Plain async functions, one per executable step type. workflow.py wraps each
in a @task so they inherit checkpointing, tracing, and cancel/usage handling
at the @task boundary — the user's step never touches that plumbing.

- execute_script: run an executable; non-zero exit raises StepError.
- execute_ai_agent: run a markdown-defined agent (<step.agent>, a project-root-
  relative path with the full filename, as the system prompt) via the Claude
  Agent SDK, same loop shape as the planning/implementation/qa agents.

approval_gate steps have no runner here — they're a pause (interrupt()) handled
inline in workflow.run_seam, since interrupt() must run in the entrypoint
body, not inside a @task.
