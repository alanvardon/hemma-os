"""MCP server exposing the orchestrator to Claude Code.

Tools:
  - implement_feature: start a workflow; returns a plan for approval
  - approve_plan:      resume an awaiting workflow with the user's response
  - resume_run:        recover a workflow that failed mid-task
  - cancel_run:        signal cancellation between task boundaries
  - run_status:        report where a (backgrounded) run stands

The flow is conversational by design. The workflow pauses at plan approval, the
user reviews via Claude Code chat, then approves or revises. Each tool call:
  - opens the AsyncSqliteSaver
  - drives one ainvoke (or resume) call
  - closes the DB and returns to Claude Code

State lives in .orchestrator/checkpoints.db between calls, keyed by the
thread_id that implement_feature generates and approve_plan replays.

Observable progress (Phase 79): the post-approval leg runs 5+ minutes, during
which Claude Code chat shows NOTHING — it doesn't render MCP progress
notifications (they're advisory per spec). So the long-leg tools accept
`background=True`: they kick the workflow off as a tracked asyncio task
(_BG_RUNS) and return {"status": "started", thread_id} at once, and the chat
polls `run_status(thread_id)` to print persistent text updates. While a run is
live it holds the AsyncSqliteSaver write-lock, so run_status reads progress
from the filesystem audit-log tail (NOT aget_state) and the final result from
the in-memory registry; it only reads the checkpoint snapshot when no task is
live (e.g. after a server restart), when the DB is free.

Testing without Claude Code (recommended first step):
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \\
    /Users/avardon/.pyenv/versions/bk-orchestrator-env/bin/python \\
    -m orchestrator.mcp_server

CRITICAL: always invoke via the full env-scoped python path, not the
"python" shim. MCP servers are subprocesses; pyenv auto-activation
doesn't apply to them (PLAN.md landmine #2).

    Use this when the user asks to implement, change, or fix something in

      - "add a tooltip showing what LTV means"
      - "fix the rounding bug in the X calculation"
      - "refactor the modal close handlers"

    The workflow ALWAYS pauses for plan approval before writing any code
    (unless `approve_plan=False` is passed, or `ORCHESTRATOR_APPROVE_PLAN`
    is set in the environment). When it pauses, this tool returns
    {"status": "awaiting_approval", ...} containing the plan and a
    thread_id. You MUST then:
      1. Show the plan's `plan_text` to the user.
      2. Ask whether they approve, or what they want changed.
      3. Call `approve_plan` with the same thread_id and their response.

    Do NOT call this tool again to "retry" — that starts a fresh workflow
    with a new thread_id, losing the user's review context. To revise an
    in-flight plan, send feedback via `approve_plan` instead.

    Idempotency: when `idempotency_key` is provided, the first call with
    that key claims it and runs the workflow as normal. A second call with
    the SAME key (e.g. double-click, retry,
    CI re-run) returns the existing thread's current state — same
    `thread_id`, no new run, with `replayed: True` added so the caller
    can tell. Keys must match `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` and are ≤128 chars.

    Args:
        request: Natural-language description of what to implement.
        approve_plan: Per-invocation override for the plan-approval gate.
            None = use `orchestrator.toml` / env var. False = skip the
            approval pause and run straight through to PR. True = require
            approval regardless of config.
        base_branch: Per-invocation override for the PR base branch.
        idempotency_key: Optional caller-supplied key. Reusing a key
            returns the existing run instead of starting a new one.
        background: When True, kick the run off as a tracked task and
            return {"status": "started", thread_id} immediately instead
            of blocking; then poll run_status(thread_id) to report
            progress in chat. The normal approval flow keeps this False
            here (planning is quick — you want the plan back to show the
            user) and passes background=True to approve_plan, which is
            where the 5+ min leg lives. Use background=True here only with

    Use this when a previous `implement_feature` or `approve_plan` call

    are three independent @tasks, so the successful steps are cached in the
    checkpointer — only the failed task (and anything downstream) re-runs.

    Use AFTER fixing the underlying issue. Examples:
      - push failed → authenticate gh, restore network, then resume_run
      - gh pr create failed (no remote, no auth) → fix auth, then resume_run
      - commit failed mid-workflow → investigate, may need manual cleanup
        before resume_run

    Do NOT use this to resume a plan-approval interrupt — that's what

    from a task failure.

    If the thread has been marked cancelled via `cancel_run`, resume_run
