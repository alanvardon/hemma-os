"""Workflow → MCP progress streaming (Phase 19).

Wraps `workflow.astream(stream_mode="updates")` and routes per-task
completion events (and heartbeat ticks during long-running tasks) to
the MCP client via `Context.report_progress`.

This is the MCP-side counterpart to `cli._run_with_progress` — same
event-loop shape, same _NEXT_STAGE label table, just a different
sink. The CLI prints to stderr; this module sends MCP progress
notifications. Either one converts the workflow's astream events
into "what's happening now" updates the human can see.

Why this exists at all: `approve_plan("yes")` previously blocked
the MCP tool call for 5+ minutes (planning → implementation → QA
→ commit → push → pr_create) with zero feedback in Claude Code chat.
With progress streaming, the client sees `done: planning (3s)` →
`running implementation (45s elapsed)` → `done: implementation
(4m 12s)` etc.

Notification failures are best-effort: report_progress is advisory
(the MCP spec lets the client ignore it), and a flaky write must
not kill the workflow. Exceptions inside the progress sink are
swallowed.
